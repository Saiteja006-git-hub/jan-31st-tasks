    <p><b>HTML</b> stands for <b>HyperText Markup Language</b>. It is the standard language used 
        to create and structure content on the web. It tells the web browser how to display text,
         links, images, and other forms of multimedia on a webpage. HTML sets up the basic 
         structure of a website, and then CSS and 
        JavaScript add style and interactivity to make it look and function better.</p>

     <p><i>How Does HTML Work? - HTML documents are plain-text files saved with an .html extension.
         Browsers read these documents, interpret the markup (tags and attributes), and render
          the formatted content on your screen.</i>

    <p>Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) is the standard markup language[a] for documents designed to
             be displayed in a web browser. It defines the content and structure of web content. It is often assisted
              by technologies such as Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) and scripting languages such as JavaScript, a 
            programming language.
            Web browsers receive HTML documents from a web server or from local storage and render the documents 
            into multimedia web pages. HTML describes the structure of a web page semantically and originally included
             cues for its appearance.
            HTML elements are the building blocks of HTML pages. With HTML constructs, images and other objects 
            such as interactive forms may be embedded into the rendered page. HTML provides a means to create structured documents by denoting structural semantics for text such as headings, paragraphs, lists, 
            links, quotes, and other items. HTML elements are delineated by tags, written using angle brackets. Tags such as <img> and <input> directly introduce
             content into the page. Other 
            tags such as and  surround and provide information about document text and may include sub-element
             tags. Browsers do not display the HTML tags but use them to interpret the content of the page.
            HTML can embed programs written in a scripting language such as JavaScript, which affects
             the behavior and content of web pages. The inclusion of CSS defines the look and layout of content. The 
             World Wide Web Consortium (W3C), former maintainer of the HTML and current maintainer of the CSS 
             standards, has encouraged the use of CSS over explicit presentational HTML since 1997.[3] A form of
              HTML, known as HTML5, is used to display video and audio, primarily using the  element, 
            together with JavaScript</p>

                <b id="two">Lists</b>

    </center>
    <p>
        HTML Lists are used to specify lists of information. All lists may contain one or more list elements.
         There are three different types of HTML lists:
<br>
Ordered List or Numbered List (ol)
Unordered List or Bulleted List (ul)
Description List or Definition List (dl)

HTML Description list is also a list style which is supported by HTML and XHTML. It is also known as definition list where entries are listed like a dictionary or encyclopedia.

The definition list is very appropriate when you want to present glossary, list of terms or other name-value list.

        <b id="three">HTML Forms</b>

</center>
<P>HTML forms are used to collect user input and send it to a server for processing.
     They are created using the ` element, which contains various input fields like text boxes, 
        checkboxes, radio buttons, and buttons. The `action` attribute defines where the form data is sent,
         while the `method` attribute specifies how the data is transmitted (`GET` or `POST`). Forms support
